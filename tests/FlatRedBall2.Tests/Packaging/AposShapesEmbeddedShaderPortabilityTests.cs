// Issue #853. Apos.Shapes' OpenGL shader is built by ShadowDusk's DXC->SPIRV-Cross pipeline, which
// (before ShadowDusk's "Rule 15" trunc() lowering, tracked as Apos.Shapes #34) emitted a bare
// trunc() call for HLSL's truncating %/fmod operator. trunc() is a GLSL 1.30 / GLSL ES 3.00
// builtin, absent from the legacy, versionless GLSL dialect MonoGame's OpenGL runtime requires --
// it silently compiled on lenient desktop drivers but failed as an undeclared identifier on macOS
// DesktopGL (Apple Silicon), crashing any Screen that drew a shape on its first frame.
//
// Apos.Shapes 0.7.8 (pinned when #853 was filed) was published ~10 hours before the ShadowDusk fix
// landed; 0.7.9+ ships it (confirmed by extracting and diffing the embedded shader resource of both
// versions' published NuGet packages). This guards the pin against ever regressing back to a build
// with the bug, independent of which exact version is pinned.
